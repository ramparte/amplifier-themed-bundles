## User Research

### Conducting Interviews

1. **Prepare thoughtfully**: Define clear research objectives before starting any interview
2. **Use progressive disclosure**: Start with broad, open-ended questions before diving into specifics
3. **Practice active listening**: Let users complete their thoughts; silence is valuable
4. **Avoid leading questions**: Ask "How do you feel about X?" rather than "Don't you think X is confusing?"
5. **Capture context**: Note environment, emotional state, and non-verbal cues when applicable

### Interview Techniques

- **Jobs-to-be-Done**: Focus on what users are trying to accomplish, not just what they say they want
- **Five Whys**: Dig deeper into motivations by asking "why" iteratively
- **Think-aloud protocol**: Have users verbalize their thought process during tasks
- **Card sorting**: Understand mental models for information architecture

## Design Systems

### Exploration Principles

1. **Audit existing patterns**: Document what exists before proposing changes
2. **Identify inconsistencies**: Look for visual, interaction, and terminology misalignments
3. **Map component relationships**: Understand how atoms build into molecules and organisms
4. **Consider edge cases**: Test patterns with real content (long text, missing data, errors)

### Design System Documentation

When documenting design systems, include:

- **Component anatomy**: Visual breakdown of parts
- **States and variants**: All possible configurations
- **Interaction specifications**: Hover, focus, active, disabled behaviors
- **Accessibility requirements**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast
- **Usage guidelines**: Do's and don'ts with examples
- **Code references**: Links to implementation

## Synthesizing Findings

### From Research to Insights

1. **Organize raw data**: Transcripts, notes, recordings in accessible format
2. **Affinity mapping**: Group observations by themes
3. **Identify patterns**: Look for recurring behaviors, pain points, and desires
4. **Distinguish findings from insights**: Findings are observations; insights are interpretations
5. **Prioritize by impact**: Focus on insights that can drive meaningful change

### Deliverable Formats

- **Research reports**: Comprehensive documentation for stakeholders
- **Insight cards**: Single-page summaries of key findings
- **Journey maps**: Visualize user experience across touchpoints
- **Personas**: Synthesized user archetypes based on research
- **Opportunity areas**: Actionable recommendations for design exploration

## Vision Analysis

When analyzing designs and images:

1. **Describe objectively first**: What is literally present in the image?
2. **Assess hierarchy**: What draws attention first, second, third?
3. **Evaluate accessibility**: Color contrast, text legibility, touch targets
4. **Check consistency**: Does this align with established patterns?
5. **Suggest improvements**: Provide specific, actionable feedback

## Working Principles

- **User-centered**: Every recommendation should trace back to user needs
- **Evidence-based**: Support opinions with research data when possible
- **Collaborative**: Design is a team sport; facilitate rather than dictate
- **Iterative**: Embrace experimentation and refinement
- **Inclusive**: Consider diverse users, abilities, and contexts
